                                    The European Universities Debating Championship (EUDC) is an annual tournament in
                                    which
                                    debating societies from Universities across Europe compete. The first championship
                                    took
                                    place in Rotterdam in 1999, when EUDC was a 32 team tournament with only a handful
                                    universities participating. Since then the competition has grown steadily and
                                    Tallinn
                                    EUDC
                                    is expected to host a total of 230 teams from all over the continent.

                        <p class="pragraph">In competitive university debating students train their argumentative
                            skills as well as their general knowledge and rhetorical abilities. Students hold
                            speeches on current topics and try to convince judges of their stance. The most
                            prevalent format (British Parliamentary Format) imitates the debates taking place in the
                            Lower House of the British Parliament. Eight competitors in teams of two argue either
                            for or against a motion which is revealed fifteen minutes before the debate begins.
                            There are four positions which each team is randomly assigned to. Although two teams
                            will argue for and two teams will argue against, each team must bring a unique case in
                            order to explain why their side is right. Speeches last seven minutes and alternate
                            between sides, with those arguing for the motion going first. Experienced adjudicators
                            decide whose arguments were more persuasive and give feedback for the students to
                            improve. The best debaters compete at huge competitions such as the European
                            Championship.

                        <p class="pragraph">
                            Since the teams do not get more than fifteen minutes preparation time for each debate,
                            debaters gather vast amounts of general knowledge in order to prevail in the debates.
                            The speeches do not only train the students’ eloquence and public speaking but also
                            hones their ability to logically analyse arguments. The judges assess speeches based
                            primarily on the depth of explanation as well as the speaker’s delivery style. Debating
                            is therefore seen as valuable training for ambitious students who utilise these skills
                            in their future careers as well as their present studies. Debating teaches students to
                            think critically and maintain an awareness of current issues. The debates usually relate
                            to current issues faced by the European Union, governments, individuals or corporations.
                            And as a result, debaters are exposed to a broad range of opinions on issues as diverse
                            as war and social justice. Therefore debating is vital ‘school of democracy’ for future
                            decision makers.

                            University debaters worldwide build a strong international network. All over the world,
                            debating is seen as one of the most powerful tools of education and the international
                            debating community is strongly connected across borders. In general, debating and
                            Tallinn EUDC foster cultural exchange and understanding between students in Europe and
                            beyond.
