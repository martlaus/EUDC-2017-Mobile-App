# Tallinn EUDC 2017 Mobile Application

## Setting up Ionic

First, install [Node.js] 4 (Node 5 does not work at the moment!). 

Then, install the latest Cordova and Ionic command-line tools.
```
$ npm install -g cordova ionic
```
Install local dependencies (run in project root folder):
```
$ npm install
```

To start the application, go to the projects folder and type this on the command-line and hit enter.
```
$ ionic serve
```
